\title{Reproject data from source to target coordinate system.}
\description{
reproj provides helpers for easily reprojecting generic data, by depending
on a reprojection engine (proj4 for now).
}
\details{
The function \code{reproj} is designed to take an input data set \code{x} and then a
\code{target} coordinate system specification. The \code{source} argument is not positional
(must be named) and must be provided.
Currently the coordinate system may be a 'PROJ string' or 'EPSG code' either
as  a number or text.

Methods are provided for data frame and matrix, add S3 methods for
you classes in your own package. For classed objects, or objects with a known
method for finding the 'source' coordinate system your method can provide
that logic.
